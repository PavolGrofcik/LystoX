Lystox is annotation tool that can help experts in domain to create 
segmentation mask (*ground truth*) from medical data.  
  
Developing this tool was a first part of bachelor thesis.
The prior goal was to make dataset with masks for convolutional
neural network UNET to train and segment T-Lymphocytes.
